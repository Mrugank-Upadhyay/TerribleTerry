# Terrible Hack Project

Terrible Hack is a hackathon in which people hack together terrible ideas. The code on this repo will **not be any good**. I'm just messing around.

### Requires
Python 3.6, pyperclip (from pip3 install)

### Random info
We used git (obvs), python, pyperclip, twitter, autohotkey, and many more.
